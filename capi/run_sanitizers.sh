# `cbindgen` cannot work with sanitizers, so we need to avoid building crate
# with `cbindgen` when enabling sanitizers. We can generate the library and
# the header that will be used during the test in advance, and then disable
# the build script, which uses `cbindgen`, to run the tests with sanitizers.

# Generating the library and the header that will be used during the test is
# necessary, before running `test_build_ffi` with sanitizers. If no FFI library
# is built, `cargo build --lib` will be executed in `test_build_ffi` to
# generate the FFI library we need. However, when `RUSTFLAGS="-Z sanitizer=*"`
# is set when building the FFI library, then the library will need symbols
# in `__*san_` pattern and we will need to set those `*San` symbol via `-l`
# when running `test_build_ffi`. Otherwise the linking will fail.
# To avoid those linking settings, the simplest way is to build the FFI
# library in advance, and running test with pre-built FFI library.
